  <p style="position:absolute;top:4200px;left:5%;font-size: 23px;">The standards that apply to kaiseki cuisine greatly differ from the modern Japanese cuisine. The Yamazato menu is composed according to the classic kaiseki structure. Our menus are carefully put together by Executive Chef Masanori Tomikawa. The kitchen distinguishes itself by focusing on the purity of seasonal, traditional Japanese ingredients. The style is minimalistic and all dishes are in balance, from taste and texture to the appearance and colours of the dishes. The dishes, tableware as well as the kimonos of the waitresses are all immersed in symbolism according to the changes of the season.
    <br>Chef Masanori Tomikawa with decades of experience, is dedicated to his task to create the perfect experience for every guest. His fascination with food started at a young age. Tomikawa has spent many years in Japanese kitchens, which you will taste in his refined authentic dishes, the haute cuisine of Japan.
