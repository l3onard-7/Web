    Born on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Hideki Endo grew up learning everything there is to know about hospitality and service.
    His family ran a hotel and his father was a chef, so it was no surprise when young Hideki fell in love with the art of cooking. For nine years he trained as a sushi master in the city’s finest establishments.
    In 2006 he joined Nobu for the opening of the Hong Kong InterContinental. Now Executive Chef at Matsuhisa Paris, Hideki Endo is playing his part in bringing Nobu Matsuhisa’s take on Japanese cuisine to a French audience.</p>
