 Commitment to clean
</h1>
<p class="qq">As we welcome you back to our hotels around the world, we are committed to providing you with a safe environment that aligns with expert protocols for working to defeat COVID-19. Consisting of in-house and outside experts in food and water safety, hygiene and infection prevention, and hotel operations, our Marriott Cleanliness Council is redefining our cleaning and safety standards. We will actively monitor and evolve our solutions to ensure a continued focus on the health and safety of our guests and associates.</p>
<div class="ice"><p class="ii"> Face coverings</p>
    <p class="oo">Providing a safer environment for our guests and associates is a top priority.

        For the U.S. - fully vaccinated guests are no longer required to wear face coverings or social distance in indoor or outdoor areas of the hotel, unless required by local law. We ask that unvaccinated guests and associates continue to wear face coverings and practice social distancing when they are in public spaces inside the hotel. All Associates working in substantial or high transmission areas as defined by the CDC are required to wear face coverings when indoors.
        
        For Canada, face coverings are optional for guests and Associates in jurisdictions where face coverings are not required to be worn indoors. Hotels should follow their provincial guidance, unless their local municipal/regional guidance is more stringent.
        
        For Caribbean and Latin America, face coverings are required for guests and associates in all indoor public areas.</p>
