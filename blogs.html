    <div  style="color: cornsilk;font-family: monospace;position: relative; bottom: 200px;font-size: 17px;">
    <p >We conducted a Aeromodelling worshop at our college for two days spanning from 9-09-18 to 10-09-18</p>
    <p  >For all the enthusiastic students who wanted to be introduced to the wondrous world of aeronautics.</p>
    <p  > The worshop was divided into two different halves, mainly theoretical and practical for the students to experience both ends of the spectrum.</p>
    <p  > A huge pool of knowledge was shared among everybody and it was a two-way learning street. </p>
        <p  >The main objective was to channel all their enthusiasm and transform it into something which actually is of value in the real world.</p>
